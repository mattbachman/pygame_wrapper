pygame_wrapper
==============

This was built using python3.2 and pygame, but I think it is backwards compatible with python2.7, havent tried it,
feel free to and let me know!

a wrapper class to simplify setup of pygame games

the main part of this project is in gameEngine.py, the other files are going to be/are examples.

Feel free to use, if you do, please throw me some credit.
